This repository contains the C# code I wrote for a real time strategy game run in Unity. Additional project settings and setup files, required to get the project running in Unity, are not contained here but may be available upon request. 


The project is approximately 11k lines of code spread across ~150 C# files (Unity scripts).


For the most interesting code, see files pertaining to [unit behavior](Assets/WorldObject/Behavior) and [unit state](Assets/WorldObject/StateScripts/UnitStates)

NOTE: some of the formatting has not carried over well from VS code (indentations, etc.). I plan to clean this up soon.
