This repository contains the C# code I wrote for a real time strategy game run in Unity. Additional project settings and setup files, required to get the project running in Unity, are not contained here but may be available upon request. 

A playable demo of the game is available [here](https://punzer-ta.itch.io/tanget-watch).

The project is approximately 16k lines of code spread across ~200 C# files.


For the most interesting code, see files pertaining to [unit behavior](Assets/WorldObject/Behavior) and [unit state](Assets/WorldObject/StateScripts/UnitStates).

NOTE: some of the formatting has not carried over well from VS code. I have only cleaned this up for the above linked folders.
