This repository contains the C# code I wrote for a real time strategy game run in Unity. Additional project settings and setup files, required to get the project running in Unity, are not contained here but may be available upon request. 


The project is approximately 11k lines of code spread across about 150 C# files (Unity scripts).


For the most interesting code, see files pertaining to [unit behavior](Assets/WorldObject/Behavior) and [unit state](Assets/WorldObject/StateScripts/UnitStates)
